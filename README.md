# Leonopoly
## Description
Leonopoly is a person verse person game in which the player’s goal is to become the wealthiest player in the game through buying properties and earning money from rent on their properties. The winner is the player that has the most money when another player goes bankrupt. 
Each player moves around the board by rolling a pair of dice. Then they are transported to the corresponding location on the board where 3 things may occur:
1.	If the property is unowned they will be prompted to purchase. They can accept or decline the purchase proposal.
2.	If they own a street they will be able to build houses on the street.
